# Congressional Bills

Congressional Bills is an online app that lets you view a list of all Congressional Bills that were introduced in 2021. 
Future versions will go back further in time. When a Bill is clicked, more detailed information about the Bill will be displayed. It also allows you to type in a comment about that specific bill. Again, future versions will display more details and allow user to create an account to be able to see who made the comments.
